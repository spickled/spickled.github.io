    <h2>History</h2>
    <p class="history">Abbi officially joined the company when she was 15 years old. She was incredibly efficiant with the equipment since her mother worked for the company for many years. Her father worked from home, but did similar work. Many people claim that she was sweet and friendly during their collaborations. Over time they started to see a shift in her behavior, becoming more aggressive and irritated by the simplist of things. Her eventual promotion to head scientist came earlier than everyone expected, but upon being told the good news she kept a blank face. The next day she was more pale than normal and anyone that held an object after her was shocked to find it so cold. <span class="alarm">Almost like something drained all of her passion.</span></p>
      <p class="history">Everyone was worried about her, but nothing was brought up during the boost in business. They were extremely busy due to <a href="2results.html" id="trueHidden">some new results</a> that required everyone's attention. Even people that didn't have any experience in the field.</p>
    <p class="history">Abbi's relationship with Petrona is unknown to anyone since Petrona dissapeared. Not a single tear dropped from her eye, <span id="hidden">makes sense since she knew what exactly happened to her.</span> We're still trying to get information regarding the disappearance of our staff. Please be patient. Although we know that it's difficult, we can only release so much information to the public. Our sincerest apologies to their families and everyone affected by this.</p>
    <!--I wonder if she was the one that put the whole thing together?-->
