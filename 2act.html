    <h1>Start</h1>
    <h2>Thank God that you made it, we've been waiting for someone to make it this far.</h2>
    <p>You may be a little confused, but I'm afraid that I can't just tell you what's going on. If anyone mentions their names, they'll know. There's no other way of explaining what's happening. Please just be patient and keep your guard up.</p>
    <p>We've been informed that they know what's going on, putting us in more danger than ever before. [.... .] is nothing compared to [.... . .-.]</p>
    <p>I'll leave hidden clues, just like before. Find the true ending, we believe in you. If at any point you start to find that the clues are running thin, you're getting closer. The first page that you have to go to is provided <a href="2begin.html">here</a></p>
