    <h2>History</h2>
    <p class="history">Cade joined the company on <span class="him">18/25/2010</span>. He was hired because of relations further up in corperate, and immediately showed promise. His study and research was the best that they've seen in a while. The last person that completed work this well was [REDACTED] due to [REDACTED]. He was very sercretive, keeping most personal information to himself. Certain people recall witnessing him having conversations with Kristen, his lab partner, <span class="alarm">but none are shown on record</span> and no one could specify the topic. </p>
      <p class="history">Kristen and Cade were good friends and could be seen talking outside of the facility. Leaving us to suspect something more than friends could occur, or <span class="alarm">worse.</span></p>
