    <h2 class="pUnderline">The Arms and Legs Project</h2>
    <p class="pCenter">This project was passed between many different researchers before it escaped. The last person to work on it had their office in room 120, a lab split between 3 people. Transcripts reveal that all classified information within this file was spread to people who were unauthorized. The researched this was assigned to has been dealt with and will not make the same mistake again. While in possesion, the creature(s) escaped somehow. Investigators are still looking into any potential holes or cracks that would have caused this to happen. This file has been deleted from the main page, isolated strictly for authorized personel.</p>

    <h2 class="pUnderline">The Head Project</h2>
    <p class="pCenter">With it's short lifespan, The Head was not assigned to any particular scientist. Almost everyone was called to contain this figure with some still busy on other projects. Overnight, a giant gash appears across the width of the blob. It started just as something that looked like a paper cut but was later revealed to be the outline for a mouth. This reveal came when the entire wedge that the gash outlined disappeared. The Head bled until it began to flood the floor, which previously had no drain connected to. The only solution that was constructed, and was reliable, was to throw it over a cliff nearby. They had to work quick to remove it from the facility so that the blood didn't spread any unknown diseases. Once it was outside, the cut had hollowed out the skin inside to where a make shift heart could be seen. It resembled a human heart, but was difficult to tell through the skin barrier. The only person that noticed this part didn't notify anyone until days after the Head was thrown off the cliff and into the murky waters below. He was promptly fired after he spilled the information he was able to capture. Once he was dealt with, camera footage was able to prove the existance of a heart. They have not yet relocated the Head for further research.</p>

    <h2 class="pUnderline">Henosis</h2>
    <p class="pCenter">They named this creature "Henosis", who has no known photo record. This thing didn't have a set assigned room or scientist. We have suspicion that an employee created it, but there is no further evidence as far as we're aware. People recall seeing it stumbling down hallways before disappearing within seconds. Scientists that worked on previous projects said that it reminded them of their nightmares they had after each one, where all of the creatures would be stitched together and wreak havoc on anything within miles of it. Groaning is the only evidence that has been gathered regarding what sounds Henosis makes. Employees that have been close enough to hear these noises state that they're extremely quiet and tend to only be noticible while within 10 feet of it.
    Rumor has it, this anamoly was created in <a class="loink" href="2lost.html">the lost lab.</a></p>
