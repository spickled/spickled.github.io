    <h2>History</h2>
    <p class="history">Ethan joined the company on <span class="him">18/25/2010</span>. He was first hired as one of the janitors, but after expressing his skill and knowledge of basic programming he was promoted to an intern. The more he worked, the more impressed his boss was. Over years of hard work he was eventually promoted to head programmer. We're honestly surprised that he got the title because of the consistant nagging of being included on projects. (jokes)</p>
    <p class="history">Ethan's co-workers have no memory of him. <span class="alarm">Perhaps their memory was fried.</span> No matter the event that caused it, they still recall pleasant moments with him.</p>
