    <h1>Welcome, [VALUED EMPLOYEE]</h1>
    <h4 class="pCenter">You've made it this far, which is impressive from the start, but we regret to inform you that your efforts were of no value. Everyone is dead. They have been for decades by the time you see this. Any sort of hope that you were given was a complete lie.</h4>
    <h4 class="pCenter">We suppose that, since you're demise is imminent, we'll tell you the full story. The person that was giving you clues from the start was in fact a real person. However. The longer they were trapped in the lab, the more decayed and melted their brain became. This lead to their eventual death. Abbi was a cover up. The facility wasn't morally sound and everyone that ever worked there for longer than a month was tested on. It was ran like a cult. In order for everyone to continue to trust our brand, we had to cover it up with someone that we paid handsomely. Abbi Skota was the perfect fit. The monster wasn't our idea but helped our case none the less. In fact, it was the incident that caused "the lost lab" to be the "lost lab". Yes, we understand that letting this whole scenario even happen in the first place wasn't very correct to begin with. Our response is that, no one had a future there. They were gone the moment that they entered that building for their first day. We have the monster under lockdown. This is the end of your little adventure. Hope you enjoyed it while it lasted. </h4>
