    <h2>History</h2>
    <p class="history">Kristen started working for the company on <span class="him">18/25/2010</span>. She showed up every day of the week, exept for one day per month. Her desk was the most plain in the building with nothing exciting or extraordinary. <span id="hidden">Probably why she was the first one to go.</span> She loved to talk about her vacations which she took on the weekends. It was always with her family, which she didn't have much of left. They created the most interesting stories that would entertain the entire floor. Brownies were her favorite dessert to bring in on Monday. It made everyone feel better and increased productivity by 10% for that week. She always changed the special ingrediant everytime. Different kinds of nuts, chocolates, or sprinkles.</p>
    <p>She worked along side Cade, but never really spoke much. <span class="alarm">No conversations are on record.</span> </p>
