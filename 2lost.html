    <h3>Rumors</h3>
    <h4 class="pCenter">We cannot legally confirm nor deny the truth about any information regarding the laboratory</h4>
    <p class="pCenter">"The Lost Lab" earned its title through rumors passing around that an experiement went wrong due to some unforeseen safety issues, and was eventually boarded up due to government request to do so. The scientists that were involved in the experiment did not survive, and that was one of the first pieces of information that spread within days. There are no records on said scientists, leaving them unknown and lost to time. Their families were notified of the incident before long. This room is most likely the answer to why the building looks much larger on the outside than it actually is on the inside. The door was completely painted over, smoothing it and disguising it into the rest of the wall. People have speculated where this door is located, although no location has been confirmed. Many brave souls have searched and ripped parts of walls before being apprehended. They no longer work at the company. <br> Someone that worked on the removal of the entrance eventually came out publicly and announced an update. They explained that, before it was sealed away, three computers were installed to power the server that runs the company website. They relied on there being no problems, which would eventually lead to them losing all of their research. Luckily, only about 60% of the information was uploading due to the long wait that came with installation. This only set the researchers back by a few years.</p>
    <p class="pCenter">The worse part about this story is what was left behind in the room, which lead to many aweful occurences throughout the world. Each story has a similar cause, but different experiences. They never really gave it an official name. Especially since they weren't even aware that this was created in the first place. People described it as a darkened, slimy mirror. It has a smooth outward appearance, but sticks to anything that touches it. Some people even stated that they saw it in a form of gas like steam or a cloud. Even while in a gas like form, it retained it's darker color. <br> What does this strange substance do exactly? It's difficult to tell due to scarce conditions. One story that we were able to get our hands on describes it as a dangerous, <a class="loink" href="2close.html">weird</a> place. They recall being able to see what was happening on our end while on the other side. Out of the 3 people that we interviewed, this one says that they were replaced with another version of themselves that looked the exact same. Fortunately they were able to find a way out, but the others' stories were told by their families. There is no way to over exaggerate the impact that all of these people felt, even years after it happened. </p>
    <p class="him">Fun fact, I was friends with a person that knew the girl in the rumor paragraph. I was told that you couldn't tell the difference between the doppelganger and her.</p>

    <h3>News</h3>
    <p class="pCenter">Naturally, the media was all over this once word got out that they were cutting off their connection to this lab. Many reporters tried to get within 20ft of the facility, but was promptly denied. Their only source were the scientists that had access to the inside. However, any and all employees were warned that if they found out that information was leaked, key word if, that all employees would recieve a paycut and a sentence in jail. We were unable to find out the length of the sentence due to the scientist we were interviewing being unavailable for the final half. Investigations pending for information on that can of worms.</p>

    <h4 class="pCenter">The source that orginally posted these has been dealt with occordingly, and the pargraphs have since been taken down. Only a minute amount of people have viewed this information, but we fear that number will grow</h4>
