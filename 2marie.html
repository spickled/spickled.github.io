    <h2>History</h2>
    <p class="history">Marie joined the company just a few years before the incident, leaving her confused but not phased. No one really can say that they've talked to her. She was never the social type. Her research didn't reach very far, especially since she wasn't able to prove herself for bigger projects. It was main;y kept to smaller ones, like what happened to Ethan's sandwich in the breakroom. She obviously wasn't happy about her position but continued to work hard. She shared a room with Abbi and Petrona, but rarely ever spoke to them.</p>
    <p class="history">She only wrote results down on paper, which was eventually shredded thoroughly so as information didn't spread. Nor Abbi or Petrona ever knew exactly what she was working on at any given moment. She made them very uneasy. Most days Marie was out, <span class="alarm">especially the days that were announced to record conversations.</span></p>
