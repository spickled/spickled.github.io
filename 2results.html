    <h1>Anomalies</h1>
    <h2>This page contains every known anomaly that has been discovered by this facility</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="anomaly">The Fun House</h3>
    <p class="pCenter">This anamoly has been classified as 'the fun house' due to its properties. It's a box room, roughly the size of a football field. The only entrance resembles a bouncy-house arch with a shiny plastic like texture. The inside contains a concrete finish, something like an unfinished basement. Creature looking characters line the walls reaching the ceiling, some being suspended by thin wires. Upon close inspection the creatures are remenistic of circus clown. Photographs of these creatures reveal the truth. In every occurance so far, all the characters share a similar endoskeleton. Metal and plastic are visible in every photo. </p>
    <p class="him">The next one is important, pay close attention</p>

    <h3 class="anomaly">Mouth</h3>
    <p class="pCenter">The Mouth may not be a new anomaly. The shape is showing signs of age through wrinkles similar to senior wrinckles. <span class="alarm">It's color within is fading faster than ever anticipated, we fear that it may not last much longer.</span> Despite that, we're not exactly sure how long it's lived or how it will continue to live. The beating heart <span class="alarm">inside</span> is our first clue to the life of the mouth. Strange sounds can be heard while in close proximity to the figure. Researchers have described it as <span class="alarm">screams</span>, similar to ones movie producers might use for horror films. Rumors have spread that <span class="alarm">[REDACTED]</span> and <span class="alarm">[REDACTED]</span>'s disappearance has something to do with the Mouth, but nothing has been confirmed yet. </p>
  <p class="him"> Not many people live past 24 hours after viewing the mouth. No one knows what exactly kills them.</p>
    <!--i'm surprised that i'm still alive after all this time. I had front row view to it-->

    <h3 class="anomaly">The Shoe</h3>
    <p class="pCenter">The shoe is the only known occurance of this type. It resembles a typical gym shoe, complete with the laces tied in a neat bow. No smell has been recorded so we're unsure if it's been used by anything. During the day the anomaly seems calm, with no movement being observed. It shifts one inch to either its left or right overnight. No bones were found within the shoe, but there is a 0.003% chance that a human collarbone appears around the shoe itself. No video has been taken of the bone materializing. Pictures were taken the evening before and the morning after, showing that it's the shoe causing this strange occurance.</p>
    <p class="him">I always hated the shoe, despite the fact that it was my only project I had the chance to work on.</p>

    <h3 class="anomaly">The Torso</h3>
    <p class="pCenter">The torso's autonomy is exactly the same as a human's. Complete with the bones and muscles necessary for function. Whether or not the torso belongs to a human body is uncertain. While it could be from a human, it's missing a few key parts. The arms and legs are completely cut off and the skin appears to have grown over the cut, but there isn't any other indication that this was the case. The areas are too clean to have been carelessly cut, but human skin does not have the properties to create such a smooth finish. Research on this anomaly has ended, but the torso still remains within the facility.</p>
    <p class="him">This always creeped me out. Just thinking that a human torso could possibly just be sitting in a room somewhere, untouched.</p>

    <h3 class="warning">The Head</h3>
    <p class="pCenter">[ REDACTED ]</p>
    <p class="pCenter">This information has been deleted for security reasons. This cannot be <a class="loink" href="2undone.html">undone.</a></p>
    <p class="him">The only thing I could get from this file was that the mouth was completely cut out, and they couldn't get it to stop bleeding for months. They threw it off a nearby cliff as a solution.</p>

    <!--this thing is scarier in person than you think. especially when it's all put together-->
    <h3 class="anomaly">[ MISSING ]</h3>
    <p class="pCenter"><span class="alarm">WARNING:</span> This anomaly has gone missing with no trace of where it went. We are investigating at this time. The page with be updated once it returns.</p>
    <!--I think this was the arms and legs, makes sense since there isn't another completely deleted entry-->

    <p class="him">...</p>
