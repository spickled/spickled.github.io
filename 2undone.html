    <p>Abbi: Why didn't you take the job?</p>
    <p>Pretrona: I don't know.....maybe because of the pay? Should I have taken it?</p>
    <p>Abbi: Of course you have! The pay here can't be any better. Why waste this opportunity?</p>
    <p>Petrona: Well. Honestly, where they were contacting from was a little farther than I would like to drive. Plus
      here is within the community that I grew up in, so I'm a little more familiar with it.</p>
    <p>Abbi: Makes sense. Hopefully you find somewhere better than here though, you don't deserve to be treated like you
      do.</p>
    <p>Petrona: It pays the bills, so I probably won't be leaving anytime soon.</p>
    <p>Abbi: Could you pass me the notebook? I gotta look at something real quick.</p>

    <p>Petrona: Hey, Kristen brought in those brownies today. I would highly recommend getting one this week before
      they're all gone.</p>
    <p>Abbi: mhm, sorry, I'm a little busy at the moment.</p>
    <p>Petrona: Oh, well when you have the chance.</p>
    <p>Abbi: GOD could you PLEASE just WORK FOR ME.</p>
    <p>Petrona: Need a little help? What's going on?</p>
    <p>Abbi: I'm trying to get a string through here, but it's just not lining up. Not really a teamwork kind of task
      Just luck.</p>
    <p>Petrona: Alright then. I'm gonna get started on the next project. <span class="strikeThru"> The Arms and

    <p>Abbi: Mhm, could you please shush though.</p>

      the A and L project?</p>
    <p>Abbi: ...</p>
    <p>Petrona: I think they lost it, honestly. They tend to loose a lot of things most of the time. Remember when they
      lost the entire 3rd floor? God, we need to get new corperate members.</p>
    <p>Abbi: The current members are fine.</p>

    <p>Abbi: Yes. I am quite sure. I have no idea where my lab partner went off to.</p>
    <p>Dr: Alright then. We're going to continue our investigations, and if you know any details or find anything we missed please report to someone immediately. Her loved ones are worried.</p>
    <p>Abbi: Will do. Now please leave so that I can get back to my research.</p>

        <p>Cade: You've really outdone yourself with these brownies. What did you add this time?</p>
        <p>Kristen: The same stuff you would use to make a key lime pie. Never really thought that I would be able to
          pull it off, but here we are.</p>
        <p>Cade: Dang, the tin's almost empty. Who hasn't gotten one yet?</p>
        <p>Kristen: Marie. She never showed for today, so I emailed her. Apparently she has   an allergy to one of the orginal ingredients so she's unable to have one. I'm thinking about finding a recipe that can be make without that component.</p>
        <p>Cade: That's really sweet of you. We should have more co-workers like you. Duplication would be perfect.</p>
