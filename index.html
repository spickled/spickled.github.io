  <p>You may have found this page accidentally, or you were instructed to be here. No matter the case, you have been selected by <strong class="him">[ .... .. -- ]</strong>.</p>
  <p>In the unlikely senario that you have been wrongly selected, there will be no termination of your training. Please take a few seconds to prepare yourself. Not many people survive this in one piece.</p>

  <h2 class="rule">Time To Begin</h2>
  <p>Now that you have fully prepared yourself for the trials ahead, we've got a few tests for you. They will be conducted without notifying you first and at random times. You're only responsibility during these tests are to do your best and to not look towards the <strong class="him"><a href="theRainbow.html">light under the door.</a></strong></p>

  <p>Since you were able to discover this facility, you must be a fan of the strange and unsual. We assure you that the shadows around the corner are normal and should be disregarded as halucinations. Attempting to interact with these shadows may result in death, please react accordingly.</p>
  <p>In order for you to continue we require that <strong class="him"><a href="theDrawers.html">the drawers be organized</a></strong>. Once that is out of the way, your training will resume to maximum productivity.</p>

  <p>The training will include mental, physical, and phycological tests. As mentioned above, none of these tests will be announced. They will be <a class="loink" href="personal.html">personal</a> but that will be the least of your concerns compared to physical endurance your body will be put under. Be prepared at any second, otherwise there is a high chance that you won't survive.</p>
  <p>You may think that this information is familiar or that you've seen this from somewhere. There's no saving you now, but we might as well break the news to you that you're delusional. Professional help is advised but will not be provided. Don't look into it any further for your own good. <span class="him">We know everything.</span></p>
