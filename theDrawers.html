  <h1 class="drawer">You Have Now Reached Uncharted Territories, Proceed With Caution</h1>
  <p><strong class="him">The Drawers are listening to your every word.</strong> In the event that you lose contact with your co-workers, try to stay calm and NOT look into the corner. The eyes may seem tempting to peer into but we assure you that the giberish words are entirely real. If you forget any of this information, your co-workers should be able to refresh your memory. Although after reminding you of your duties their faces may look a bit melted, they're not. We advise not to touch the liquid.</p>
  <p>There is a slight chance that this page will be discovered and overturned by <strong class="him">the drawers.</strong> Report to the nearest faculty member before anything else happens. Examples can be listed at <strong class="him"><a href="ym-34.html">ym-#$</a></strong></p>
  <p class="notes">What EVER you do, do NOT search the drawers. The senario required to have this happen isn't as rare and specific as we thought. It's much more dangerous and much more abundunt. Don't look at the contents, it's impossible to come back from it.</p>
