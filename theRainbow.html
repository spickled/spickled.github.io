  <hr>
  <p>The Rainbow is an anomoly that only appears under very strict circumstances, which has about a 0.0005942% chance of occuring. Consider yourself very lucky. You might even want to buy a lottery ticket after this, given that you have all of your fingers to do so.</p>
  <p>It also happens that this anomoly is quite dangerous, so I would advise not following the wispers. If you hear your name or a loved one's full maiden name, it's too late. Please refer back to the pamhplet as your life flashes before your eyes and assume the fetile position.</p>
